# Python
- In this project, I created a Python script that analyzed the financial records of "a company". The set of financial data is titled budget_data.csv and all the data is within that file.
- The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.
- My Python script analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
    - The total number of months included in the dataset
    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
